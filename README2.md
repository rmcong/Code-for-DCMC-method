RGBD Saliency Detection (2016-SPL)

1. This code is for the paper: 

[1] Runmin Cong, Jianjun Lei, Changqing Zhang, Qingming Huang, Xiaochun Cao, Chunping Hou, Saliency detection for stereoscopic images based on depth confidence analysis and multiple cues fusion, IEEE Signal Processing Letters, vol.23, no.6, pp.819-823, 2016.

It can only be used for non-comercial purpose. If you use our code, please cite the paper [1].

2. This matlab code is tested on Windows 10 64bit with MATLAB 2014a. 

3. Usage:

(1) put the test images into file '\RGB', the depth maps into file '\depth'


(2) run demo_DCMC.m, the RGBD saliency maps with suffix '_DCMC.png' are generated and saved in the file '\DCMC'
